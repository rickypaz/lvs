Chats are especially useful when the group chatlvting is not able to meet face-to-face, such as

* Regular meetings of students participating in online courses to enable them to share experiences with others in the same course but in a different location
* A student temporarily unable to attend in person chatlvting with their teacher to catch up with work
* Students out on work experience getting together to discuss their experiences with each other and their teacher
* Younger children using chatlv at home in the evenings as a controlled (monitored) introduction to the world of social networking
* A question and answer session with an invited speaker in a different location
* Sessions to help students prepare for tests where the teacher, or other students, would pose sample questions';

* Beeps - You can send a sound to other participants by clicking the "beep" link next to their name. A useful shortcut to beep all the people in the chatlv at once is to type "beep all".
